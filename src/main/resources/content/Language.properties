radio-liferay-info-list-provider-filtered-user-name-name=Filtered User Name

radio-liferay-info-list-provider-filtered-user-id-name=Filtered User Id
radio-liferay-info-list-provider-filtered-user-id-description=As the user name can be spoofed (by setting first & last name appropriately), a manual second run for the filter is applied, because the developer of this plugin was too lazy to create a proper dynamic query over a couple of entities.
